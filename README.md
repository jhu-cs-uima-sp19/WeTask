# WeTask

This is our final project for 601.290 - User Interfaces & Mobile Applications.

The main purpose of our app, WeTask, is to seamlessly integrate all of an individuals To-Do lists in
one place. We hope our tool  will allow groups and communities of people to communicate efficiently
and increase their overall productivity. The home page holds three main tabs: viewing your personal
tasks, viewing the tasks in the current group you are in, and viewing all of your archived tasks. Our
main color is seafoam green to take the user to an exciting and vibrant  experience.


For our first sprint of this project, we wanted to focus on the individual's experience. We were able
to create a database to hold our users with their account and all of their task information. An
individual may create a task for themselves or their other group members and edit, complete,
or delete an existing task in their 'My Tasks' page. We can currently log out and switch between
different groups but do not have the tasks change between the groups yet.

Two of our testing accounts are:
Username = Sadie
Password = 1234

Username = Zoe
Password = zoe

The current state of the app does not include the group color-coordinating functionality or the use of the
'Archive Tasks' page. We will next implement the function of creating a group, editing group members,
switching between groups and having tasks stick in their given groups. The main dynamic we hope to
change in our layout is the use of a card format instead of the current list formatting.
